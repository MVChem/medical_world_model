## Overview

<img src="imgs/fig1.png" alt="fig1" style="zoom:67%;" />

**CheXWorld** is a self-supervised world model for radiographic images, inspired by how humans develop internal models of the world to reason and predict outcomes. It learns key aspects of medical knowledge critical for radiologists, including: 1) **Local anatomical structures** (e.g., tissue shapes, textures), 2) **Global anatomical layouts** (e.g., organ and skeleton organization), and 3) **Domain variations** (e.g., differences in image quality across hospitals and devices). CheXWorld shows strong performance across eight medical imaging tasks, outperforming existing SSL methods and large-scale medical foundation models.
